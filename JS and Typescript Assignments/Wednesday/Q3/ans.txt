The bind() method returns a new function with a permanently set this value.
The first argument defines the "this" context.
Additional arguments are stored and used when the new function runs.
The original function is not modified.


The call() method invokes the function immediately and sets this to the first argument. Any additional arguments are passed directly to the function.

Basically:

Call -> Immediate execute, one time and faster
Bind -> Returns a function, reusable
